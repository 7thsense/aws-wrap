h2. Amazon Web Service Scala Libraries

This page contains informations for development of the library itself.

For information on *using* the library, see: http://pellucidanalytics.github.com/aws/index2.html

(the "2" is to somehow hide the page to the public, we'll drop it when we release.)

h3. Compiling the project

bc.. sbt build

h3. Running the tests

bc.. sbt test

h3. Generate the unified Scaladoc

bc.. sbt unidoc

h3. Working on the documentation

We're using [[https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll Jekyll]]. Checkout the gh-pages branch, and see Jekyll's documentation to test locally before committing. Usually the best is to launch Jekyll in server mode, so the pages get compiled automatically as you change them.
