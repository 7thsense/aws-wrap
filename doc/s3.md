# Getting started with S3

## Asynchronous transfers with the TransferManager

The AWS Java SDK includes [TransferManager](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManager.html),
a “High level utility for managing transfers to Amazon S3.”

It provides a simple API for uploading and downloading content to and from Amazon S3. It should achieve improved throughput and resource usage, but just as important is the ease with which one can make asynchronous transfers.

To get started, create instances of the wrapped client and the transfer manager.

```scala
val client = new AmazonS3ScalaClient(myCredentials)

val transferManager = new TransferManager(myCredentials)
```

Alternatively, you can share the underlying [S3Client](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/AmazonS3Client.html).

```scala
val transferManager = new TransferManager(client.client)
```

These classes are thread safe, and single instances should be shared whenever possible.

There is a utility method in `aws-wrap` called [FutureTransfer.listenFor]({{site.baseurl}}/api/current/index.html#com.pellucid.wrap.s3.FutureTransfer$), which is intended for working with [Transfer](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/Transfer.html) objects. For example,

```scala
FutureTransfer.listenFor {
  transferManager.upload(bucketName, key, file)
}
```

The result type of this expression is `Future[Upload]`.
