# Getting started with S3

## Asynchronous transfers with the TransferManager

The AWS Java SDK includes [TransferManager](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManager.html),
a “High level utility for managing transfers to Amazon S3.”

It provides a simple API for uploading and downloading content to and from Amazon S3. It should achieve improved throughput and resource usage, but just as important is the ease with which one can make asynchronous transfers.

To get started, create instances of the wrapped client and the transfer manager.

{% highlight scala %}
val client = new AmazonS3ScalaClient(myCredentials)

val transferManager = new TransferManager(myCredentials)
{% endhighlight %}

Alternatively, you can share the underlying [S3Client](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/AmazonS3Client.html).

{% highlight scala %}
val transferManager = new TransferManager(client.client)
{% endhighlight %}

These classes are thread safe, and single instances should be shared whenever possible.

There is a utility method in `aws-wrap` called [FutureTransfer.listenFor]({{site.baseurl}}/api/v{{site.latestrelease}}/index.html#com.github.dwhjames.awswrap.s3.FutureTransfer$), which is intended for working with [Transfer](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/Transfer.html) objects. For example,

{% highlight scala %}
FutureTransfer.listenFor {
  transferManager.upload(bucketName, key, file)
}
{% endhighlight %}

The result type of this expression is `Future[Upload]`. (More
precisely, it is the singleton type of the
[Transfer](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/Transfer.html)
object that was passed as an argument to `listenFor`.)

It is **extremely** important to note that the future returned by
`listenFor` **always** completes successfully, not matter whether the
transfer completed successfully, failed, or was canceled. It will be
completed as soon as any of these progress events occur. To determine
the actual outcome of the transfer, you **must** interogate the
transfer object itself, using the
[waitForCompletion](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/Transfer.html)
or
[waitForException](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/Transfer.html)
methods (or
[waitForUploadResult](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/Upload.html)
in the case of an
[Upload](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/Upload.html)).
While these methods are documented as ‘blocking’, if they are called
only once the future has been completed, then they will succeed
immediately, rather than block.
