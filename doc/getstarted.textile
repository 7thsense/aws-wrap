h2. Getting Started

h3. Configure your AWS secret

You need to configure your accessid and secret by creating a file @~/.awssecret@.
The first line should be your accessid, and the second line your secret.

bc. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
abcdefghijklmnopkrstuvwx/abcdefghijklmno

h3. Choose your region

AWS provides several regions in the world, the data being usually not shared among the regions.
For each service you use, you need to import the region you want to use.

For example, if you use SimpleDB and S3 in Europe:

bc. import aws.simpledb.SDBRegion.EU_WEST_1
import aws.s3.S3Region.EU_WEST_1

Failing to do so will result in a compilation error asking you to import a region.

h3. Making calls to AWS

All calls to AWS are _asynchronous_ and _non blocking_. That means that when you do a call to
AWS, you do not get a Result but rather a Future[Result].

For example, to retrieve the list of domains from a domains for a SimpleDB account:

bc.. import aws.simpledb._
import SDBRegion.US_EAST_1

val resultF = SimpleDB.listDomains()
resultF: scala.concurrent.Future[aws.core.Result[aws.simpledb.SimpleDBMeta,Seq[aws.simpledb.SDBDomain]]]
    = scala.concurrent.impl.Promise$DefaultPromise@5e9384fb
